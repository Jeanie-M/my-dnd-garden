Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options”.

***Prerequisites.*** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

***Replacing and Gaining Invocations.*** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.

You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

### Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows — its identity unclear — but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells.

***Cantrips.*** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell *Witch Bolt*, you must spend on to those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.

The number of spells increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Warlock spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

## Eldritch Invocation Options
Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order.

### Armour of Shadows
You can cast *Mage Armour* on yourself without expending a spell slot.

### Eldritch Mind
You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration.

### Pact of the Blade
As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand — a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond — or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage of its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

### Pact of the Chain
You learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, Skeleton, Slaad Tadpole, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite, or Venomous Snake.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

### Pact of the Tome
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This *Book of Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

***Cantrips and Rituals.*** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells an be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

## Warlock Spell List
The spells are organised by spell level and then alphabetised, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes — where gods dwell — and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

### Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation.

***Cantrips.*** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast wit this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.

The number of spells increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

### Level 1: Divine Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

***Protector.*** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armour.

***Thaumaturge.*** You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

## Cleric Spell List
The spells are organised by spell level and then alphabetised, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, _C_ means the spell requires concentration, _R_ means it’s a Ritual, and _M_ means it requires a specific Material component.

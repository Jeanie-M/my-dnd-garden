Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the fit of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

### Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells.

***Cantrips.*** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast wit this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Sorcerer spell list.

The number of spells increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Sorcerer spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have the spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

### Level 1: Innate Sorcery
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:
- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

## Sorcerer Spell List
The spells are organised by spell level and then alphabetised, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armour. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

### Level 1: Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

### Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation.

***Spell Slots.*** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

## Paladin Spell List
The spells are organised by spell level and then alphabetised, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

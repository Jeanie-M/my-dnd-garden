Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

### Level 1: Rage
You can imbue yourself with primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armour.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

***Rage Damage.*** When you make an attack using Strength — with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike — and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

***Strength Advantage.*** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

***No Concentration or Spells.*** You can’t maintain Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.

***Duration.*** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armour or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

### Level 1: Unarmoured Defence
While you aren’t wearing any armour, your base Armour Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

![Weapon Mastery.png|right|200](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Weapon%20Mastery.png)

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Master column of the Barbarian Features table.

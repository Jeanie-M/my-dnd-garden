### Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects.

***Tools Requires.*** You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves’ Tools, Tinker’s Tools, or another kind of Artisan’s Tools with which you have proficiency as your Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an *M* component when you cast it).

***Cantrips.*** You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Artificer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast wit this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells.

The number of spells increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Artificer spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

### Level 1: Tinker’s Magic
You know the *Mending* cantrip.

As a Magic action while holding Tinker’s Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing the item from the following list:
- Ball Bearings
- Basket
- Bedroll
- Bell
- Blanket
- Block and Tackle
- Bottle, Glass
- Bucket
- Caltrops
- Candle
- Crowbar
- Flask
- Grappling Hook
- Hunting Trap
- Jug
- Lamp
- Manacles
- Net
- Oil
- Paper
- Parchment
- Pole
- Pouch
- Rope
- Sack
- Shovel
- Spikes, Iron
- String
- Tinderbox
- Torch
- Vial

The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it vanishes.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Artificer Spell List
The spells are organised by spell level and then alphabetised, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

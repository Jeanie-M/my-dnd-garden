The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons — scaly, bright-eyes, and thick-boned with horns on their heads — and their colouration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.

## Dragonborn in Wildemount
Wildemount was the cradle from which all dragonborn civilisation grew. The city-state of Draconic rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonising dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconic swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin.

Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilisation, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread our across the world.

### Regions
#### Dwendalian Empire
The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favours and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labour. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur.

Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labour for lodging there.

#### Menagerie Coast
Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment.

Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth — even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend of hucksters, peddlers, and thieves.

#### Xhorhas
Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks — though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.

### Variants
#### Draconblood
Draconbloods possess long tails and a knack for social manipulation. They remember the days when they were once mighty conquerors.

#### Ravenite
Ravenites have no tails and a hearty physique. They remember the days when they were slaves to the draconblood, as well as the day when they overthrew their masters.

## Dragonborn Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

***Draconic Ancestry.*** Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits as well as your appearance.

###### Draconic Ancestors
| Dragon | Damage Type |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |
***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Draconic Flight.*** When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

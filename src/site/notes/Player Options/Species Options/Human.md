Found throughout the multiverse, humans are as varied as they are numerous, and they endeavour to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their ambition and resourcefulness are commended, respected, and feared on many worlds.

Humans are as diverse in appearance as the people of Earth, and they have many gods.

## Humans in Wildemount
The most populous species in Wildemount, humans define common culture across the continent. Their unrelenting ambition creations societies that aggressively pursue productivity while valuing leisure, and their short life spans often lead humans to romanticise the ugly past and fear the unknown future.

### Regions
#### Dwendalian Empire
In the Dwendalian Empire, humans are everywhere and occupy every walk of imperial life.

Humans recoil from the unknown in ways that longer-lived folk do not, and nations dominated by a nonhuman majority are a tremendous source of fear and suspicion to human-majority nations. Human survival instinct stokes the flames of fear, especially when those flames are amply fuelled by nationalistic propaganda. Such is the relationship between the Dwendalian Empire and the drow0majority Kryn Dynasty of Xhorhas.

Other societies — including Uthodurn’s pluralistic society of elves and dwarves — are less maligned. However, this is because the average citizen of the empire knows nothing about those societies, reducing them to objects of curiosity for imperial scholars.

#### Menagerie Coast
Within the Clovis Concord, humans are seen as adept diplomats, nation builders, and loyal soldiers. They are the most populous people of the Menagerie Coast, but ever since the founding of the Clovis Concord, that nation has been one defined by its diversity. Although other nations of Wildemount and the world might consider humans to be the definitive, adaptable jacks-of-all-trades, the people of the Concord know that all folk have this capacity.

#### Xhorhas
Humans are rare in Xhorhas, and those found within that land typically belong to wandering clans or are soldiers of the Dwendalian Empire. Aside from such soldiers, humans are not viewed with inherent suspicion by most Xhorhasians, but the war between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire has made Xhorhas an even more dangerous land for all human travellers. Dark elves and monsters that might treat a wandering human with caution elsewhere are likely to attack on sight in Xhorhas, because they know that an imperial human will do the same to them.

Each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of Genasi.

A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.

## Genasi in Wildemount
Genasi are exceedingly rare on Exandria, as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attune Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as a result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.

Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might had blue-tinged skin or appear to sweat profusely at all times.

### Regions
#### Dwendalian Empire
Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of the genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse — and who survive — often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.

#### Menagerie Coast
Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.

#### Xhorhas
Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.

The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.

### Genasi Names
Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.

### Subspecies
#### Air Genasi
Air genasi are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, their moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

Air genasi typically has light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh.

#### Earth Genasi
Earth genasi are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though they aren’t necessarily evil. They have inherited some measure of control over earth, revelling in superior strength and solid power. They tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider their options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals.

#### Fire Genasi
Fire genasi have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. They tend toward impatience and making snap judgements. Rather than hide their distinctive appearance, they exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-grey skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

#### Water Genasi
The lapping waves, the spray of the sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths — these things call to a water genasi’s heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. They wander freely and take price in their independence, though others might consider them selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in colour. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickly streams.

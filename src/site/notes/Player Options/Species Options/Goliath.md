Towering over most folk, goliaths are distant descendants of giants. Each goliath bears the favours of the first giants — favours that manifest in various supernatural boons, including the ability to quickly grow and temporarily approach the height of goliaths’ gigantic kin.

Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they count as kin, goliaths have forged their own path in the multiverse — unencumbered by the internecine conflicts that have ravaged giantkind  ages — and seek heights above those reached by their ancestors.

## Goliaths in Wildemount
The goliaths of Exandria are a mighty people with stone giant blood running in their veins. Most stand well cover seven feet tall and are blessed with a naturally powerful physique. Like their giant progenitors, goliaths are a rare sight in Wildemount. Most live on the isolated peaks of the Cyrios Mountains, the Penumbra Range, and on the isolated land of Eiselcross. Those few goliaths who are exiled from their hers and wander into more densely peopled lands are uniformly greeted with fear and confusion.

Goliaths have a compulsion to compete and keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills. Above all else, they are driven to outdo their past efforts. Few goliaths reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past achievements.

Among goliaths, any adult who can’t or won’t contribute to the herd is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.

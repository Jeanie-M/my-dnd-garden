A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander.

From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies — usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or grey. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.

## Aarakocra in Wildemount
Many people across Wildemount consider the winged aarakocra to be a myth, so infrequently do they descend from their lofty aeries to deal with wingless folk. Where they are known, the aarakocra rarely engage with the land-bound societies of Wildemount, though some take great pleasure in travelling on the open ocean with Concord sailors and Revelry pirates. Some legends say that Melora the Wild Mother created the aarakocra as storm herders who drive the clouds across the sky, and some aarakocra tribes play a sport called *h’aara-shie*, or “cloud chasing,” that reflects this ancient tale.

### Regions
#### Dwendalian Empire
Within the empire, most aarakocra keep to the hidden settlement of Vol’antim in the Cyrios Mountains. The appearance of an aarakocra is seen as a blessing in the settlements of the Truscan Vale and the Marrow Valley — often much to the aarakocra’s embarrassment. Most rural folk consider the aarakocra to be angels of Erathis the Law Bearer, no matter how diligently the aarakocra explain otherwise.

#### Menagerie Coast
The few aarakocra who descend from the Cyrios Mountains or emerge from the canopy of the Quoraska Jungle for longer than a day or two are often swept up in the beauty of the sea. Thus enamoured, many join a ship’s crew and set out to explore the Lucidian Ocean with their new allies. The common people of the Menagerie Coast look upon the aarakocra’s bright wings wit awe and dream about taking to the sky, but are often baffled by their seemingly nonsensical idioms and figures of speech.

#### Xhorhas
Aarakocra are native to the mountains and jungles of western Wildemount, and have precious few settlements in the mountains surrounding Xhorhas. The average Kryn dark elf would react tot he sight of an aarakocra with shock, for they have neither stories nor experience with such creatures.

### Aarakocra Names
As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other species, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

As an Aarakocra, you have the following special traits.

***Wind Caller.*** When you reach character level 3, you learn *Gust of Wind*. You always have this spell prepared.

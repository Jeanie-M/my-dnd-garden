Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of invention, illusions, and life underground. The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes’ secretive nature and their propensity for living in forests and burrows. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness. They confounded predators with traps and labyrinthine tunnels.

Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that “roof” is nothing more than a hat.

## Gnomes in Wildemount
Gnomes are not native to Wildemount, and are relatively uncommon even in an age of swift boats from Marquet and flying airships from Tal’Dorei. They hail from the distant continent of Issylra and were largely content to remain there after the Calamity. In lands inhabited by people taller and stronger than them, gnomes often resort to living exclusively among other gnomes for their own security. This attitude has kept the gnomes of Wildemount safe for generations, but it has also instilled many gnomish societies with a pernicious strain of xenophobia.

### Regions
#### Dwendalian Empire
Two major ethnic groups exist within the Dwendalian Empire, once centred in the mountain-city of Hupperdook and the other in the wooded Velvin Thicket. The rock gnomes of Hupperdook originally settled the Silberquel Ridge, and formed their enclave as a defence against bandits and brigands who hunted their kind for sport. This settlement predated the rise of the empire, and after a long and unprecedented period of imperial diplomacy — rather than conquest — the Hupperdook gnomes were finally convinced to add their cultural knack for invention to the empire’s might.

The forest gnomes of the Velvin Thicket had resisted imperial takeover for decades. As a result, though most people in the empire see gnomes as their loyal friends and allies, many folk in the empire’s western reaches view gnomes as obstinate, backcountry hicks.

#### Menagerie Coast
Large numbers of gnomes live within the Clovis Concord, primarily in the city of Gwardan, where a group of gnomes who seceded from Hupperdook settled before the Concord’s founding. Just as the elves of Gwardan were the metaphorical architects of the original concordance that founded the nation of city-states, the gnomes of Gwardan were the literal architects of the Clovis Concord’s magnificent cities and halls of governance. A rock gnome by the name of Ionia Marbleweaver is revered as the grandmother of Concordian art and architecture for her innovative use of columns, frescoes, and friezes, all of which feature prominently in the great buildings of the Menagerie Coast’s cities.

#### Xhorhas
Most Xhorhasians’ only contact with gnomes is a brief glimpse of a deep gnome scurrying about the Underdark carrying armfuls of gems. The deep gnomes have little interest in surface politics, and even try to stay neutral in the underground war between the Kryn Dynasty and the duergar rebels. For the most part, the deep gnomes and their settlements are small enough to remain unnoticed by larger folk.

### Subspecies
#### Deep Gnome
Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are natives of the Underdark and are suffused with that subterranean realm’s magic. They can supernaturally camouflage themselves, and their svirfneblin magic renders them difficult to locate. These abilities have enabled them to survive for generations among the perils of the Underdark.

#### Forest Gnome
Forest gnomes have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth.

#### Rock Gnome
Rock gnomes have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes.

## Rock Gnome Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Gnomish Cunning.*** You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Gnomish Lineage (Rock Gnome).*** You know the *Mending* and *Prestidigitation* cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting *Prestidigitation* to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a top, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from *Prestidigitation*; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes the fire; the device doesn’t do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilise action. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the species).

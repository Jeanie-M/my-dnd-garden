## Who are the Cerberus Assembly?
The Cerberus Assembly are most well known within the Dwendalian Empire. In the last few centuries, it has subtly ingrained itself within most facets of the empire’s government, becoming a force of political and military power that many say could rival the king himself. The mages of the assembly are known for their extravagant lifestyles and intimidating history of political and economic control, and much of the populace mistrusts them, though no one dares to cross them or the king.

## Balenpost
The general populace do not know much about Balenpost, many may not even have heard its name. Balenpost stands on the southwestern edge of the island of Foren in Eiselcross. Run by mages of the Cerberus Assembly, the citizens are dedicated to planning and executing expeditions to uncover Aeorian items on the island.

Many Dwendalians with nothing to lose come to Balenpost to earn good pay, but may of the other explorers are prisoners quietly approached by the Cerberus Assembly and offered freedom in exchange for service.

Here are the steps to make a character.

1. **Choose a Class.** Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s vocation, special talents, and favoured tactics.
2. **Determine Origin.** A character’s origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors? You can also choose your character’s languages.
3. **Determine Ability Scores.** Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character’s six abilities.
4. **Choose an Alignment.** Alignment is a shorthand for your character’s moral compass.
5. **Fill in Details.** Using the choices you’ve made, fill in the remaining details on your character sheet.

## Step 1: Choose a Class
Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.

![[Database - Classes.base]]

### Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character sheet. We are starting at level 1.

### Note Armour Training
Your class might give you training with certain categories of armour. Note your armour training on your character sheet. Armour training with a kind of armour means you can wear that armour effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it.

### Hold That Thought
You’ll fill in more details about your class later. Choosing your class is the most important decision you make in creating a character, and it informs many of the decision you make in later steps. You’ll return to your class’s description several more times before you’re done.

## Step 2: Determine Origin
Determining your character’s origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.

A character’s background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character’s earliest days.

### Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background, and write it on your character sheet.

The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character’s ability scores.

![[Database - Backgrounds.base]]

***Record Your Feat.*** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Write the feat on your character sheet.

***Note Proficiencies.*** Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet

Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.

The features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus, which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.

### Choose Starting Equipment
Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment. In addition, you can have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table).

Record your chosen equipment on your  character sheet. There’s also space on the character sheet to note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment, as well as treasure you acquire on your adventures.

### Choose a Species
Choose a species for your character. Once you’ve chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species’ traits.

Your character’s size and Speed are determined by the character’s species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).

![[Database - Species.base]]

### Imagine Your Past and Present
Let your character’s background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character’s present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:
- Who raised you?
- Who was your dearest childhood friend?
- Did you grow up with a pet?
- Have you fallen in love? Is so, with whom?
- Did you join an organisation, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?

### Choose Languages
Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.

#### Standard Languages
| Language             | Origin     |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Common               | Exandria   |
| Common Sign Language | Exandria   |
| Draconic             | Dragons    |
| Dwarvish             | Dwarves    |
| Elvish               | Elves      |
| Giant                | Giants     |
| Gnomish              | Gnomes     |
| Goblin               | Goblinoids |
| Halfling             | Halflings  |
| Marquesian           | Marquet    |
| Naush<br>            | Ki-Nau     |
| Orc                  | Orcs       |
| Zemnian              | Zemniaz    |
***Marquesian.*** The Menagerie Coast was settled by colonists from the arid land of Marquet, and their language now holds an unusual position in the Clovis Concord. It is the language of high society, as many Clovis elite are descended from Marquesians, but it is also the language of piracy, since countless lower-class Marquesians defected from the Concord and formed the Revelry pirates.

***Naush.*** Originally spoken by the Ki’Nau islanders native to the Menagerie Coast, Naush is a thriving language within the multicultural cities of the Clovis Concord. Even sailors who only speak Common incorporate dozens of Naush words into their nautical jargon.

***Zemnian.*** This ancient language was spoken by the people of Zemniaz in the Age of Arcanum. That ancient culture has long since crumbled, but its language and its people live on in the Dwendalian Empire. Many ancient scrolls were written in Zemnian, but it is a language now largely spoken by farmers, as Common is the default language of the empire.

---
The Rare Languages table lists languages that are either secret or derived from other planes of existence and thus less widespread.

#### Rare Languages
| Language      | Origin                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Abyssal       | Demons of the Abyss      |
| Celestial     | Celestials               |
| Deep Speech   | Aberrations              |
| Druidic       | Druidic circles          |
| Infernal      | Devils of the Nine Hells |
| Primordial    | Elementals               |
| Sylvan        | The Feywild              |
| Thieves’ Cant | Various criminal guilds  |
| Undercommon   | The Underdark            |
***Primordial.*** Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects. Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with those that know a different one.

## Step 3: Determine Ability Scores
To determine your character’s ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities.

### Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using the following method.

***Random Generation.*** Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.

### Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s primary ability.

### Adjust Ability Scores
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

Some players like to increase their class’s primary ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.

### Determine Ability Modifiers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

#### Ability Scores and Modifiers
| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :------: |
|   3   |    -4    |
|  4–5  |    -3    |
|  6–7  |    -2    |
|  8–9  |    -1    |
| 10–11 |    +0    |
| 12–13 |    +1    |
| 14–15 |    +2    |
| 16–17 |    +3    |
| 18–19 |    +4    |
|  20   |    +5    |
### Describe Appearance and Personality
Ability scores are an essential part of the rules, but they can be more than that. Once you’ve assigned your ability scores, give some thought to what those scores might say about your character’s appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Charisma might look and behave differently from a charismatic character with ow Strength.

## Step 4: Choose an Alignment
Choose your character’s alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet.

D&D assumes that players character’s aren’t of an evil alignment. Check with me before making an evil character.

### The Nine Alignments
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behaviour of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behaviour.

![Alignment.png|500](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Alignment.png)

***Lawful Good (LG).*** Lawful Good creatures endeavour to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.

***Neutral Good (NG).*** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.

***Chaotic Good (CG).*** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.

***Lawful Neutral (LN).*** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life — and isn’t swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil — is probably Lawful Neutral.

***Neutral (N).*** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.

***Chaotic Neutral (CN).*** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.

***Lawful Evil (LE).*** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.

***Neutral Evil (NE).*** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.

***Chaotic Evil (CE).*** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.

### Alignment and Personality
Alignment can shape a character’s personality, goals, and core beliefs. Looking at the two elements of an alignment, think about how this affects your character’s personality, and why they have this alignment.

## Step 5: Fill In Details
Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

### Record Class Features
Look at your class’s feature table, and write down the level 1 features.

Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices. 

### Fill In Numbers
Note these numbers on your character sheet.

***Saving Throws.*** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throw they’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

***Skills.*** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

***Passive Perception.*** Sometimes your DM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects general awareness of your surroundings when you’re not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:

**Passive Perception** = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier

Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

***Hit Points.*** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

#### Level 1 Hit Points by Class
| Class                                        | Hit Point Maximum  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Barbarian                                    | 12 + Con. modifier |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger                  | 10 + Con. modifier |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 8 + Con. modifier  |
| Sorcerer or Wizard                           | 6 + Con. modifier  |
The character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s also space to track Death Saving Throws.

***Hit Point Dice.*** Your class’s description tells you the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.

***Initiative.*** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.

***Armour Class.*** Without armour or a shield, your base Armour Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armour or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the armour/Shield modifiers. A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

***Attacks.*** In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon’s property says otherwise:

**Melee attack bonus** = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus

**Ranged attack bonus** = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Look up the damage and properties of your weapons. You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.

***Spellcasting.*** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus

**Spell attack bonus** = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.

***Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.*** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them — along with your number of spell slots — on your character sheet.

### Name Your Character
Choose a name for your character, and write it on your character sheet. The name can be whatever you like. Was it the name of an ancestor? Does it have religious or other significance? Is it a name you chose for yourself?

### Create Final Details
As you finish creating your character, consider whether you’d like to make up any other details about the character. Here are the sorts of things you might ask yourself as the character:
- What’s your gender?
- What person or people do you care about most?
- What’s your deepest fear?
- On your adventures, will you seek knowledge, wealth, glory, enlightenment, justice, mercy, power, or something else?
